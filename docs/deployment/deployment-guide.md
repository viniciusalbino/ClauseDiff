# Deployment Guide

## 6.4.1 Create Deployment Guide
- **Objective:** Provide step-by-step instructions for deploying the application.
- **Steps:**
  1. Push changes to `main` (production) or feature branch (preview)
  2. Netlify automatically builds and deploys
  3. MCP server handles backend/serverless deployment
  4. Monitor Netlify deploy logs for success/errors
- **Notes:**
  - Use Netlify dashboard for manual deploys or rollbacks
  - Use MCP dashboard for backend/serverless management

## 6.4.2 Document Rollback Procedures
- **Objective:** Ensure safe and quick rollback in case of deployment issues.
- **Procedures:**
  - Use Netlify's atomic deploys to instantly rollback to previous version
  - MCP server: redeploy previous backend version if needed
  - Document rollback steps in `docs/deployment/`
- **Best Practices:**
  - Test rollback regularly
  - Document known rollback issues and solutions

## 6.4.3 Create Monitoring Guide
- **Objective:** Monitor deployments, application health, and performance.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Use Netlify deploy logs and status checks
  - Use MCP server monitoring for backend/serverless
  - Integrate with external monitoring (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) for errors and performance
- **Documentation:**
  - List all monitoring tools and dashboards
  - Document alerting and escalation procedures

## 6.4.4 Document Incident Response
- **Objective:** Provide a clear plan for responding to deployment or runtime incidents.
- **Plan:**
  - Detect incident via monitoring/alerts
  - Communicate with team and stakeholders
  - Rollback or hotfix as needed
  - Document incident in postmortem
  - Update deployment and incident response docs as needed
- **Conclusion:**
  - A clear deployment, rollback, monitoring, and incident response process ensures reliable, resilient releases and fast recovery from issues.
