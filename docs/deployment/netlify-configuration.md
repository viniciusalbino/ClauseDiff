# Netlify Configuration Review

## 6.1.1 Review Build Settings
- **Objective:** Ensure build settings are optimized for performance and reliability.
- **Current Setup:**
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Publish directory: `dist/`
  - Node version: specified in `netlify.toml` or environment
  - MCP server integration: enabled for backend API proxying
- **Recommendations:**
  - Confirm Node and npm versions match local dev environment
  - Use Netlify caching for `node_modules` and build artifacts
  - Monitor build times and optimize dependencies

## 6.1.2 Assess Deployment Strategy
- **Objective:** Validate deployment flow for main and preview branches.
- **Current Setup:**
  - Main branch auto-deploys to production
  - Pull/feature branches deploy to unique preview URLs
  - MCP server used for backend API and serverless functions
- **Recommendations:**
  - Use branch deploy contexts for environment-specific settings
  - Enable atomic deploys and rollbacks
  - Monitor deploy logs for errors and warnings

## 6.1.3 Review Environment Variables
- **Objective:** Ensure secure and correct use of environment variables.
- **Current Setup:**
  - API keys, secrets, and config set in Netlify dashboard
  - MCP server endpoints and credentials managed via environment
- **Recommendations:**
  - Audit variables for secrets and rotate as needed
  - Use Netlify's secret management for sensitive values
  - Document all required variables in `docs/deployment/`

## 6.1.4 Document Configuration
- **Objective:** Maintain up-to-date documentation of Netlify and MCP configuration.
- **Documentation:**
  - List all build, deploy, and environment settings
  - Document MCP server integration and endpoints
  - Provide troubleshooting and rollback procedures
- **Conclusion:**
  - Netlify and MCP provide a robust, scalable deployment platform. Regular reviews and documentation updates are essential for reliability and security.
