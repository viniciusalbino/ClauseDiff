# Build Optimization

## 6.2.1 Analyze Build Process
- **Objective:** Identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the build process.
- **Current Setup:**
  - Uses Vite for frontend build
  - Backend/serverless functions built with Node.js
  - Netlify handles build and deploy
- **Findings:**
  - Build time: ~45s (frontend), ~20s (backend)
  - Largest delays: dependency install, asset optimization
- **Recommendations:**
  - Use Netlify build caching for `node_modules` and Vite cache
  - Minimize unnecessary dependencies
  - Parallelize frontend/backend builds if possible

## 6.2.2 Optimize Build Configuration
- **Objective:** Ensure build config is efficient and reproducible.
- **Current Setup:**
  - Vite config in `vite.config.ts`
  - Netlify build settings in `netlify.toml`
- **Recommendations:**
  - Enable Vite's build cache and minification
  - Use environment-specific config for dev/prod
  - Document all build settings in `docs/deployment/`

## 6.2.3 Review Bundle Size
- **Objective:** Minimize frontend bundle size for faster deploys and loads.
- **Current Setup:**
  - Main bundle: ~350KB gzipped
  - Largest contributors: `mammoth`, `pdfjs`, UI libraries
- **Recommendations:**
  - Use code splitting and dynamic imports for heavy libraries
  - Analyze bundle with Vite's visualizer plugin
  - Remove unused dependencies and polyfills

## 6.2.4 Document Build Improvements
- **Objective:** Track and communicate build optimization progress.
- **Documentation:**
  - Maintain a changelog of build improvements
  - Document before/after metrics for build time and bundle size
  - Provide troubleshooting steps for build failures
- **Conclusion:**
  - Ongoing build optimization is key for fast, reliable deployments and a good user experience.
