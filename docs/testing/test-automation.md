# Test Automation

## 5.4.1 Set Up CI Test Pipeline
- **Objective:** Automate test execution for all code changes.
- **Setup:**
  - Use GitHub Actions (or similar) for CI.
  - Run unit, integration, and E2E tests on push/PR.
  - Enforce coverage thresholds (fail build if below target).
- **Best Practices:**
  - Fast feedback (run tests in parallel).
  - Isolate test environments.

## 5.4.2 Configure Test Reporting
- **Objective:** Provide clear, actionable test results for developers.
- **Setup:**
  - Use coverage reporters (lcov, HTML, summary).
  - Integrate with PRs (status checks, comments).
  - Store historical reports for trend analysis.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Highlight failed tests and coverage drops.
  - Link reports to documentation.

## 5.4.3 Create Test Documentation
- **Objective:** Ensure all tests and test processes are documented.
- **Documentation:**
  - Maintain test strategy, structure, and patterns in `docs/testing/`.
  - Document how to run, debug, and write tests.
  - Provide onboarding guides for new contributors.

## 5.4.4 Document Test Maintenance
- **Objective:** Define processes for keeping tests up to date and effective.
- **Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review and refactor tests.
  - Remove obsolete or flaky tests.
  - Update tests for new features and bug fixes.
  - Track test debt and prioritize improvements.
- **Conclusion:**
  - Automated, well-documented, and maintained tests are essential for quality, reliability, and developer productivity.
