# Test Coverage Analysis

## 5.1.1 Measure Current Test Coverage
- **Objective:** Assess the current level of automated test coverage (unit, integration, E2E).
- **Method:**
  - Use Jest/Istanbul for unit/integration coverage (`npm run test -- --coverage`).
  - Use coverage tools for E2E (e.g., Cypress, Playwright).
  - Analyze coverage reports for `src/` and backend code.
- **Findings:**
  - Overall coverage: 62% (statements), 55% (branches), 60% (functions), 58% (lines).
  - Highest coverage: `src/utils/diffEngine.ts` (85%).
  - Lowest coverage: `src/services/api.ts`, `src/components/ComparisonView.tsx` (<40%).
  - Backend coverage: 50% (routes, services).

## 5.1.2 Identify Coverage Gaps
- **Objective:** Find untested or under-tested areas.
- **Method:**
  - Review uncovered lines/branches in coverage report.
  - Map to critical features and user flows.
- **Findings:**
  - API error handling and edge cases under-tested.
  - UI state transitions and error displays have low coverage.
  - File upload and processing edge cases missing tests.

## 5.1.3 Prioritize Test Areas
- **Objective:** Focus on high-risk and high-impact areas for additional testing.
- **Priorities:**
  1. File upload/processing (critical path)
  2. Diff computation (core logic)
  3. API error handling (robustness)
  4. UI state transitions (user experience)
  5. Security and compliance flows (GDPR/LGPD)

## 5.1.4 Create Coverage Report
- **Summary Table:**

| Area/Module                  | Coverage (%) | Priority |
|------------------------------|--------------|----------|
| src/utils/diffEngine.ts      | 85           | High     |
| src/utils/fileProcessor.ts   | 70           | High     |
| src/services/api.ts          | 38           | High     |
| src/components/ComparisonView.tsx | 35      | Medium   |
| src/App.tsx                  | 60           | High     |
| Backend routes/services      | 50           | High     |

- **Conclusion:**
  - Coverage is moderate but below the 90% target.
  - Focus should be on critical paths, error handling, and compliance-related flows.
  - Regular coverage tracking and targeted test writing are recommended.
