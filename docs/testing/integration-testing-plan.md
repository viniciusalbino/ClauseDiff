# Integration Testing Plan

## 5.3.1 Design Integration Test Suite
- **Objective:** Validate interactions between multiple components/services.
- **Suite Structure:**
  - Place integration tests in `test/integration/`.
  - Cover end-to-end flows: file upload, diff processing, result rendering, export.
  - Use real or mock backend as appropriate.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Test critical user journeys and edge cases.
  - Use setup/teardown for test data and environment.

## 5.3.2 Create Test Scenarios
- **Objective:** Define key integration scenarios for coverage.
- **Scenarios:**
  1. Upload DOCX/PDF/TXT, process, and view diff.
  2. Handle file upload errors (invalid type, size limit).
  3. API error propagation to UI.
  4. Export diff results (PDF, CSV).
  5. Consent and compliance flows (GDPR/LGPD).
- **Documentation:**
  - List scenarios in `docs/testing/` for reference.

## 5.3.3 Set Up Test Environment
- **Objective:** Provide a stable, isolated environment for integration tests.
- **Setup:**
  - Use Docker or local test server for backend.
  - Use test database or in-memory storage.
  - Configure environment variables for test mode.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Reset state between tests.
  - Use CI for automated integration runs.

## 5.3.4 Document Integration Tests
- **Objective:** Ensure all integration tests are documented and traceable.
- **Documentation:**
  - Maintain a test matrix mapping scenarios to tests.
  - Document setup, teardown, and expected outcomes.
- **Conclusion:**
  - A robust integration testing plan ensures reliability across user flows and supports compliance and quality goals.
