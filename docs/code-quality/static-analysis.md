# Static Analysis Setup

## 2.1.1 Configure ESLint with TypeScript Rules
- **Objective:** Enforce code quality and catch errors early.
- **Setup:**
  - ESLint with `@typescript-eslint` plugin
  - Rules: no-unused-vars, no-explicit-any, consistent-return, etc.
  - Config in `.eslintrc.js` or `package.json`
- **Best Practices:**
  - Run `eslint` on pre-commit and CI
  - Use strictest rules tolerable for the team

## 2.1.2 Set Up Prettier for Code Formatting
- **Objective:** Ensure consistent code style across the codebase.
- **Setup:**
  - Prettier config in `.prettierrc`
  - Integrate with ESLint via `eslint-plugin-prettier`
  - Format on save in editor and on commit
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use a shared config for all contributors
  - Document formatting rules in `docs/code-quality/`

## 2.1.3 Configure SonarQube or Similar Tool
- **Objective:** Automate code quality checks and maintain metrics.
- **Setup:**
  - SonarQube (self-hosted or cloud) or alternatives (CodeClimate, DeepSource)
  - Integrate with CI for automatic analysis
  - Track code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, and coverage
- **Best Practices:**
  - Set quality gates for PRs
  - Review and address issues regularly
- **Conclusion:**
  - Automated static analysis is essential for maintaining high code quality and reducing technical debt.
