# TypeScript Analysis

## 2.3.1 Review TypeScript Configuration
- **Objective:** Ensure TypeScript is configured for safety and maintainability.
- **Config:**
  - `tsconfig.json` uses `strict: true`, `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`
  - Paths and aliases set for clean imports
- **Recommendations:**
  - Keep config strict for new code
  - Document config in `docs/code-quality/`

## 2.3.2 Assess Strict Mode Compliance
- **Objective:** Check for any files or modules not using strict typing.
- **Findings:**
  - Most code is strict-compliant
  - Some legacy/test files use `any` or loose types
- **Recommendations:**
  - Refactor legacy/test files to use strict types
  - Add lint rule to prevent `any` in new code

## 2.3.3 Identify Type Safety Improvements
- **Objective:** Find areas where type safety can be improved.
- **Findings:**
  - Some API responses and utility functions use loose types
  - Some props are typed as `any` or `{}`
- **Recommendations:**
  - Define interfaces/types for all API responses
  - Use generics and utility types for reusable logic
  - Add type tests for critical modules

## 2.3.4 Document Type System Usage
- **Objective:** Document how types and interfaces are used across the codebase.
- **Documentation:**
  - All major modules use interfaces for props, state, and data models
  - Utility types and enums used for consistency
  - Type system usage documented in `docs/code-quality/`
- **Conclusion:**
  - TypeScript is used effectively, with some areas for stricter typing and better documentation.
