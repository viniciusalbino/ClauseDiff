# Optimization Planning

## 4.3.1 Design Web Worker Implementation
- **Objective:** Offload CPU-intensive diff computation from the main thread to web workers (frontend) and worker threads (backend).
- **Plan:**
  - Refactor `src/utils/diffEngine.ts` to support web worker interface.
  - Use `Worker` API in React components for large file diffs.
  - Backend: Use Node.js worker threads for parallel diff processing.
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents UI blocking for large files.
  - Improves scalability for concurrent users.

## 4.3.2 Plan Code Splitting Strategy
- **Objective:** Reduce initial bundle size and improve load times.
- **Plan:**
  - Use dynamic `import()` for heavy libraries (e.g., `mammoth`, `pdfjs`).
  - Split routes and major components in `src/App.tsx` and `src/components/`.
  - Leverage Vite's code splitting and lazy loading features.
- **Benefits:**
  - Faster initial load, especially on mobile.
  - Only load code needed for current view.

## 4.3.3 Design Caching Strategy
- **Objective:** Improve performance by caching results and static assets.
- **Plan:**
  - Frontend: Use browser cache and service workers for static assets.
  - Backend: Cache recent diff results in memory (with size/TTL limits).
  - Consider CDN for static files and API responses.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces redundant processing and network usage.
  - Improves perceived performance for repeat operations.

## 4.3.4 Create Optimization Roadmap
- **Phased Roadmap:**

| Phase | Focus                | Key Actions                                      | Timeline |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1     | Web Workers          | Implement frontend web workers, backend threads  | 1-2 mo   |
| 2     | Code Splitting       | Refactor for dynamic imports, lazy loading       | 2-3 mo   |
| 3     | Caching              | Add frontend, backend, and CDN caching           | 3-4 mo   |
| 4     | Load Testing         | Simulate 1,000+ users, optimize infrastructure   | 4-5 mo   |
| 5     | Continuous Tuning    | Monitor, profile, and optimize regularly         | Ongoing  |

- **Conclusion:**
  - Optimization should be iterative, starting with the most impactful changes (web workers, code splitting), followed by caching and infrastructure improvements.
