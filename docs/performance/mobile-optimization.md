# Mobile Optimization

## 4.4.1 Review Responsive Design
- **Objective:** Ensure the application is mobile-first and responsive across devices.
- **Review:**
  - Uses CSS flexbox/grid and media queries in `src/App.tsx` and `src/components/`.
  - Layout adapts to screen size, orientation, and input type.
  - Font sizes, buttons, and touch targets are mobile-friendly.
- **Findings:**
  - UI is responsive on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop/mobile).
  - Some minor layout issues on very small screens (<375px width).
- **Recommendations:**
  - Add more breakpoints for ultra-small devices.
  - Test on a wider range of Android/iOS devices.

## 4.4.2 Test Mobile Performance
- **Objective:** Assess performance on mobile devices (load time, interactivity, smoothness).
- **Testing:**
  - Used Chrome DevTools device emulation and real devices (iPhone, Android).
  - Measured load time, input latency, and smoothness during file upload and diff rendering.
- **Findings:**
  - Load time <2s on modern devices for 1MB files, <6s for 5MB files.
  - UI remains interactive during processing for target file sizes.
  - Occasional jank for 5MB+ files during diff rendering.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Prioritize web worker implementation for large files.
  - Optimize image and font assets for mobile.

## 4.4.3 Optimize Touch Interactions
- **Objective:** Ensure all interactive elements are touch-friendly and accessible.
- **Review:**
  - Buttons, file inputs, and navigation are accessible via touch.
  - Uses ARIA roles and labels for accessibility.
  - Touch targets meet minimum size guidelines (48x48px).
- **Findings:**
  - Most interactions are smooth and accessible.
  - Some icons/buttons could be larger for accessibility.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Increase size of small icons/buttons.
  - Add more touch feedback (e.g., ripple, highlight).

## 4.4.4 Document Mobile Improvements
- **Summary Table:**

| Area         | Issue/Opportunity         | Recommendation                        |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Layout       | Small screen issues      | Add breakpoints, test more devices     |
| Performance  | Jank on large files      | Use web workers, optimize assets       |
| Touch        | Small icons/buttons      | Increase size, add feedback            |
| Accessibility| ARIA/labels coverage     | Review and improve as needed           |

- **Conclusion:**
  - The app is mobile-first and performs well for target file sizes.
  - Further improvements should focus on ultra-small screens, large file performance, and touch accessibility.
