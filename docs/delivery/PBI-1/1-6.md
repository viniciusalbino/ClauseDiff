# [1.6] Enhance test setup file with custom render functions and global test utilities

## Objective
Enhance the test setup infrastructure with custom render functions, global test utilities, and helper functions to streamline testing across the entire test suite.

## Status History
- **2024-01-06 18:20**: Task started
- **2025-01-06 20:45**: Task completed - All test utilities implemented and tested (27/27 tests passing)

## Requirements
- Create custom render functions for React components with providers
- Add global test utilities for common testing patterns
- Implement helper functions for authentication testing
- Set up custom matchers for improved assertions
- Create utilities for async testing and error handling
- Provide wrapper functions for different testing scenarios

## Implementation Plan

1. Create custom render functions with providers (NextAuth, Router, etc.)
2. Add global test utilities and helpers
3. Implement authentication testing utilities
4. Create custom Jest matchers
5. Add async testing helpers
6. Set up error boundary testing utilities

## Test Plan

- Verify custom render functions work with all providers
- Test global utilities provide consistent behavior
- Validate authentication helpers work correctly
- Confirm custom matchers provide better assertions
- Test async utilities handle promises and timers properly

## Verification

- [x] Custom render functions work with React components
- [x] Global test utilities are available in all test files
- [x] Authentication helpers simplify auth testing
- [x] Custom matchers provide better error messages
- [x] Async helpers properly handle timing and promises
- [x] Error boundary testing works correctly

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive test utilities infrastructure with:

### Custom Render Functions (test/utils/render.tsx)
- 9 specialized render functions for different scenarios
- Provider support for NextAuth, Router, and Error Boundaries
- Factory function for creating custom render utilities
- Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

### Authentication Testing Utilities (test/utils/auth-helpers.ts)
- Complete authentication state management and assertions
- Session creation and manipulation utilities
- Login/logout flow simulation
- Role and permission-based testing helpers
- Quick access convenience functions

### Async Testing Utilities (test/utils/async-helpers.ts)
- Promise utilities for delays, resolution, and rejection
- Timer controls with fake timer setup
- Loading state testing patterns
- Network request simulation
- Debounce/throttle testing utilities

### Custom Jest Matchers (test/utils/custom-matchers.ts)
- 20+ custom matchers for authentication, errors, DOM, arrays, and business logic
- Enhanced error messages and better test readability
- Automatic registration with Jest

### Error Testing Utilities (test/utils/error-helpers.ts)
- Error factory for different error types
- Sync and async error throwing utilities
- Enhanced error boundary component with retry functionality
- Error propagation and recovery testing patterns

### Central Export Point (test/utils/index.ts)
- Unified API with organized structure
- Lazy-loaded test kit for performance
- Quick access utilities for common patterns
- Test scenarios and helper functions

### Test Results
- **27 out of 27 tests passing** (100% success rate)
- Comprehensive integration testing of all utilities
- Zero-dependency implementation
- Full TypeScript support with proper type safety

The test utilities infrastructure is now ready for production use and provides a solid foundation for testing across the entire application.
