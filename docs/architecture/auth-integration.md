# Authentication Integration Points (Future)

## Overview
This document outlines where and how authentication logic will be integrated into the ClauseDiff codebase, following Clean Architecture and Next.js 14 conventions.

## Integration Points

### 1. Auth Route (API Layer)
- **File:** `app/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- **Purpose:** Handles authentication API routes (e.g., NextAuth, custom JWT endpoints).
- **Extensibility:**
  - Can be implemented using NextAuth.js, custom JWT logic, or other providers.
  - Add additional routes as needed for login, logout, callbacks, etc.

### 2. AuthProvider (Presentation Layer)
- **File:** `src/presentation/providers/AuthProvider.tsx`
- **Purpose:** React context/provider for authentication state and actions.
- **Usage:**
  - Wraps the application (e.g., in `layout.tsx` or `page.tsx`).
  - Exposes authentication state (user, loading, error) and actions (login, logout, refresh).
- **Extensibility:**
  - Can be connected to NextAuth client, custom hooks, or other state managers.

#### Example Usage (future)
```tsx
import { AuthProvider } from '@presentation/providers/AuthProvider';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return <AuthProvider>{children}</AuthProvider>;
}
```

## Notes
- No authentication logic is implemented yet; these are placeholders for future expansion.
- Choose provider (NextAuth, custom, etc.) based on project needs.
- Update this document as integration progresses.
