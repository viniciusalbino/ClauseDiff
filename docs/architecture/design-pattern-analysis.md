# Design Pattern Analysis

## 1.3.1 Identify Implemented Design Patterns
- **Objective:** Catalog design patterns used in the codebase.
- **Patterns Identified:**
  - **Container/Presentational:** `App` as container, UI components as presentational
  - **Custom Hooks:** For file processing, API calls, and state logic
  - **Factory Pattern:** For diff engine instantiation (if multiple diff types)
  - **Strategy Pattern:** For supporting multiple file types and diff algorithms
  - **Error Boundary:** For error handling in React tree

## 1.3.2 Document Pattern Usage and Effectiveness
- **Usage:**
  - Container/presentational split improves separation of concerns
  - Custom hooks encapsulate reusable logic
  - Strategy/factory patterns allow extensibility for new file types/algorithms
  - Error boundaries prevent UI crashes
- **Effectiveness:**
  - Patterns are used consistently and appropriately
  - Code is modular, testable, and easy to extend
  - Some areas (API, file processing) could benefit from more explicit pattern use

## 1.3.3 Recommend Pattern Improvements
- **Recommendations:**
  - Use the Strategy pattern more explicitly for diff and export logic
  - Consider the Observer pattern for state changes and notifications
  - Apply Dependency Injection for service and utility modules
  - Document all custom hooks and patterns in `docs/architecture/`
- **Conclusion:**
  - The codebase uses modern React and TypeScript patterns effectively, with opportunities for further modularization and documentation.
