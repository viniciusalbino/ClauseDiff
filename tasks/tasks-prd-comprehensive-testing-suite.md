### Notes

- Current test coverage is at 11.48% and needs to reach 90%
- Existing security tests are comprehensive but some unit/integration tests are missing
- Jest configuration has issues with NextAuth mocking that need to be resolved
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) needs to be set up for API mocking in tests
- Cross-browser testing will be implemented using Cypress with multiple browsers
