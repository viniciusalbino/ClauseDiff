# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Introduction/Overview

Develop a comprehensive testing suite for the ClauseDiff application to ensure code quality, security, and reliability. The testing suite will cover unit, integration, end-to-end, and security testing with automated CI/CD integration. This builds upon the existing test foundation (currently at 11.48% coverage) to achieve 90% code coverage while ensuring robust application security and performance.

## Goals

1. **Achieve 90% code coverage** across all application components and services
2. **Implement comprehensive security testing** including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and authentication bypass protection
3. **Establish automated CI/CD pipeline** with parallel test execution on develop/main branches
4. **Create maintainable test architecture** following testing best practices and pyramid structure
5. **Enable continuous quality monitoring** with performance tracking and flaky test detection
6. **Ensure cross-browser compatibility** with Chrome, Safari, and mobile device testing

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want comprehensive unit tests so that I can refactor code confidently without breaking functionality
- I want integration tests so that I can verify component interactions work correctly
- I want automated test execution so that I can catch regressions early in the development cycle
- I want clear test reports so that I can quickly identify and fix failing tests

### As a QA Engineer
- I want end-to-end tests so that I can verify complete user workflows function correctly
- I want security tests so that I can ensure the application is protected against common attacks
- I want cross-browser tests so that I can verify compatibility across different environments
- I want detailed coverage reports so that I can identify untested code paths

### As a Product Owner
- I want automated quality gates so that only well-tested code reaches production

## Open Questions

1. **Test Data Strategy**: Should we implement a factory pattern for test data generation, or prefer fixture files?
2. **Mocking Strategy**: For external APIs, should we mock at the HTTP level (MSW) or service level?
3. **Performance Baselines**: What are acceptable performance thresholds for the application under test?
4. **Security Test Automation**: Should security tests run on every commit or only on deploy branches?
5. **Test Environment Management**: Do we need a dedicated test environment, or is local testing sufficient?
