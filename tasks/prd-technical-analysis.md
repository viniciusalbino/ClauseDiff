# PBI: Technical Analysis and Improvement Plan for ClauseDiff

## Overview
This PBI aims to conduct a comprehensive technical analysis of the ClauseDiff application, identifying current architectural patterns, code quality metrics, technical debt, and opportunities for improvement. The analysis will focus on long-term maintainability, performance optimization, and adherence to best practices while ensuring compliance with GDPR and LGPD requirements.

## Problem Statement
The ClauseDiff application requires a thorough technical assessment to ensure it meets current and future requirements, including performance benchmarks, security standards, and maintainability goals. This analysis will provide a clear roadmap for technical improvements and establish baseline metrics for ongoing development.

## User Stories
1. As a developer, I want to understand the current architecture and code quality metrics so that I can make informed decisions about improvements.
2. As a project manager, I want to identify technical debt and improvement opportunities so that I can prioritize future development efforts.
3. As a security officer, I want to ensure the application complies with GDPR and LGPD requirements so that we can maintain data privacy standards.
4. As a user, I want the application to process documents efficiently (under 1 minute) so that I can complete my work without unnecessary delays.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Architecture Analysis
- Create component interaction diagrams
- Document data flow from upload to diff visualization
- Identify and document design patterns
- Analyze state management approach
- Evaluate component hierarchy and communication patterns

### 2. Code Quality Assessment
#### Metrics to Collect:
- Cyclomatic complexity for key functions
- Component coupling metrics
- Module cohesion scores
- TypeScript strictness compliance
- Code coverage (target: 90%)
- Bundle size analysis
- Performance metrics for document processing

#### Files to Analyze:
- src/App.tsx
- src/services/api.ts
- src/utils/diffEngine.ts
- src/utils/fileProcessor.ts
- src/components/ComparisonView.tsx

### 3. Security and Compliance
- Document retention policy implementation (1-hour limit)
- GDPR/LGPD compliance assessment
- Data handling and storage analysis
- Security best practices review

### 4. Performance Analysis
- Document processing time analysis
- Memory usage patterns
- UI blocking operations identification
- Web worker opportunities
- Mobile-first optimization assessment

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Current test coverage analysis
- Unit test recommendations
- Integration test planning
- Performance test scenarios
- Security test requirements

### 6. CI/CD and Deployment
- Netlify deployment process review
- Branch strategy assessment
- Automated testing integration
- Build optimization opportunities
