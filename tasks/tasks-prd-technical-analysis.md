### Notes
- Each task will require both analysis and documentation phases
- All findings should be documented in the appropriate docs/ directory
- Recommendations should be prioritized based on impact and effort
- Security and performance findings should be addressed immediately if critical
- All documentation should be clear and actionable for junior developers
- Tasks should be completed in order of priority: Security > Performance > Architecture > Testing > Code Quality > CI/CD
- Each sub-task should include:
  - Analysis phase
  - Documentation phase
  - Review phase
  - Implementation recommendations (if applicable)
- All documentation should be version controlled
- Regular progress updates should be provided to stakeholders
