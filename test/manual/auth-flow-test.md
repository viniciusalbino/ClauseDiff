# Manual Authentication Flow Tests

## Test Summary

This document outlines the manual testing of authentication flows implemented in ClauseDiff.

**Test Date**: December 2024  
**Version**: Initial implementation  
**Environment**: Development (localhost:3001)

## Test Results

### ✅ 1. User Registration Flow
**Test**: Navigate to `/register` and create a new account
- [x] Registration form loads correctly
- [x] Form validation works (required fields, email format, password confirmation)
- [x] API endpoint `/api/auth/register` creates user in database
- [x] Password is properly hashed with bcrypt
- [x] Auto-login after registration works
- [x] Redirect to success page after registration

**Test Cases Covered**:
- Valid registration with firstName, lastName, email, password
- Form validation errors for invalid inputs
- Duplicate email prevention
- Auto-login after successful registration

### ✅ 2. Credentials Login Flow
**Test**: Navigate to `/login` and log in with email/password
- [x] Login form loads correctly
- [x] Form validation works
- [x] NextAuth credentials provider authenticates user
- [x] JWT token is created and managed
- [x] Redirect to success page after login
- [x] Session persists across page refreshes

**Test Cases Covered**:
- Valid login with existing user credentials
- Invalid credentials error handling
- Remember me functionality (UI only, persistence handled by NextAuth)

### ✅ 3. Google OAuth Login Flow
**Test**: Click "Continue with Google" button
- [x] Redirects to Google OAuth consent screen
- [x] After consent, returns to application
- [x] User profile is created/updated with Google data
- [x] Redirect to success page after OAuth login
- [x] Session persists across page refreshes

**Test Cases Covered**:
- First-time Google login (creates new user)
- Existing user Google login (updates profile data if needed)
- OAuth callback handling

### ✅ 4. Logout Flow
**Test**: Click logout button on success page
- [x] NextAuth signOut function works correctly
- [x] Session is cleared
- [x] Redirect to login page
- [x] User cannot access protected content after logout

### ✅ 5. Session Management
**Test**: JWT token rotation and session persistence
- [x] JWT tokens are short-lived (15 minutes)
- [x] Token rotation works automatically
- [x] Session data is properly updated
- [x] Debug information shows token rotation in development

### ✅ 6. Security Features
**Test**: CSRF protection and security headers
- [x] CSRF tokens are set in cookies
- [x] Security headers are applied by middleware
- [x] Rate limiting is configured (tested via middleware)
- [x] Secure cookie configuration in production mode

## Implementation Status

### Completed Features ✅
- User registration with validation
- Email/password authentication
- Google OAuth integration
- JWT token management with rotation
- Session persistence
- CSRF protection
- Security headers
- Rate limiting
- User profile management
- Authentication hooks (useAuth, useRequireAuth, usePermissions)

### Pending Features ⏳
- Password recovery/reset functionality
- Email verification
- Profile editing interface
- Admin panel and RBAC implementation
- Comprehensive automated testing

## Notes

1. **Database**: Using Prisma with PostgreSQL, all user data is properly stored
2. **Security**: Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 12)
3. **JWT**: Short-lived tokens (15 min) with automatic rotation
4. **CSRF**: NextAuth built-in CSRF protection enhanced with custom middleware
5. **Cookies**: Secure configuration for production environment
6. **UI/UX**: Responsive design with proper loading states and error handling

## Test Environment

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js v4
- **Database**: Prisma + PostgreSQL
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation
